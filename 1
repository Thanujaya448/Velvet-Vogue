To implement an admin role for updating and inserting products, and a user role for saving purchase history, you need to follow these steps:

Define User Roles:

Create a table in your database to store user roles (e.g., admin, user).
Assign roles to users in your user database.
Set Up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Implement logic in your application to check user roles and grant or restrict access to certain functionalities based on their role.
Admin Functionality:

Create an interface for admins to add, update, and delete products.
Ensure that only users with the admin role can access this interface.
User Functionality:

Create an interface for users to view their purchase history.
Ensure that users can only see their own purchase history.
Here is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Step 1: Define User Roles
Create a roles table in your database:

Sql
Insert code

CREATE TABLE roles (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    role_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
Insert roles into the roles table:

Sql
Insert code

INSERT INTO roles (role_name) VALUES ('admin'), ('user');
Step 2: Assign Roles to Users
Modify your users table to include a role_id:

Sql
Insert code

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role_id INT;
Assign roles to users:

Sql
Insert code

UPDATE users SET role_id = 1 WHERE username = 'admin_user';  -- Assign admin role
UPDATE users SET role_id = 2 WHERE username = 'regular_user';  -- Assign user role
Step 3: Implement Role-Based Access Control
In your application, check the user's role before allowing access to certain functionalities.

Example in PHP:
Php
Insert code

session_start();

// Assuming you have a function to get the user's role
function getUserRole($userId) {
    // Query the database to get the user's role
    // Example:
    // SELECT role_name FROM roles JOIN users ON roles.id = users.role_id WHERE users.id = $userId
    // Return the role name
}

// Check if the user is an admin
function isAdmin($userId) {
    return getUserRole($userId) === 'admin';
}

// Check if the user is a regular user
function isUser($userId) {
    return getUserRole($userId) === 'user';
}

// Example usage
$userId = $_SESSION['user_id'];

if (isAdmin($userId)) {
    // Show admin interface
} elseif (isUser($userId)) {
    // Show user interface
} else {
    // Redirect to login or show an error
}



Step 4: Admin Interface for Managing Products
Create a form for admins to add, update, and delete products. Ensure that only admins can access this form.

Example in HTML/PHP:
Php
Insert code

if (isAdmin($userId)) {
    // Show admin product management form
    echo '<form action="manage_products.php" method="post">
            <input type="text" name="product_name" placeholder="Product Name">
            <input type="text" name="product_price" placeholder="Product Price">
            <input type="submit" name="action" value="Add Product">
          </form>';
} else {
    echo 'Access denied.';
}
Step 5: User Interface for Viewing Purchase History
Create a page for users to view their purchase history. Ensure that users can only see their own history.

Example in PHP:
Php
Insert code

if (isUser($userId)) {
    // Query the database to get the user's purchase history
    // Example:
    // SELECT * FROM purchases WHERE user_id = $userId
    // Display the purchase history
} else {
    echo 'Access denied.';
}
Step 6: Secure Your Application
Ensure that your application is secure by:

Validating and sanitizing user inputs.
Using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
Implementing proper session management.
By following these steps, you can create an admin role for managing products and a user role for viewing purchase history in your web application.
